## Introduction

A Rubikâ€™s cube is a 3D combination puzzle that has 6 faces, each face usually has 9 stickers in a 3x3 layout and the objective of the puzzle is to achieve the solved state where each face must be returned to having a unique color. Here I have applied the algorithm that will solve the Rubik's Cube. It is simple and easy way to learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube very quickly. In my program, there are 2 ways to solve the cube i.e. you have to choose that who will solve... you or computer.

*Fig. 1*: Skeleton of the cube. Color Codes: *W = White*, *R = Red*, *B = Blue*, *O = Orange*, *G = Green*, *Y = Yellow*.

We are using *pivot face* as the face of the cube to use as a reference for the sequence of moves that will be applied. You should keep this face always in front while applying any move.
 
### Basic Moves

Here are all the available moves that can be applied to the cube. Consider the *Blue* face as pivot.
 
1.  *Blue_Right_Clockwise*
2.  *Blue_Right_Anti_Clockwise*
3.  *Blue_Left_Clockwise*
4.  *Blue_Left_Anti_Clockwise*
5.  *Blue_Up_Clockwise*
6.  *Blue_Up_Anti_Clockwise*
7.  *Blue_Down_Clockwise*
8.  *Blue_Down_Anti_Clockwise*
9.  *Blue_Front_Clockwise*
10. *Blue_Front_Anti_Clockwise*
11. *Blue_Back_Clockwise*
12. *Blue_Back_Anti_Clockwise*

Each move also has one of the following two operations depending on the rotation which need to be applied to the corresponding face:

1. *90-degree rotation_Clockwise*
2. *90-degree rotation_Anti-Clockwise*

### Algorithm

Note that clockwise and counter-clockwise turns are viewed with respect to the center of the face.

The solution algorithm consists of 7 stages in general:

1. Solve *Upper layer edge pieces* thus *making a WHITE Cross* as shown below.

2. Solve *Upper layer corner pieces* and *completing WHITE Layer* as shown below.

3. Solve *Middle layer edge peices* i.e. *placing Red, Blue, Orange and Green edges in their correct position* as shown below.

4. Make *a YELLOW Cross in Bottom Layer* as shown below.

5. Solve *YELLOW corner peices in Bottom Layer* thus *completing Yellow layer* as shown below.
